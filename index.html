                <h2> Profesional Summary:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>i volunteer at my local Beavers Organisation.</li>
                    <li>in the past i have worked at a soft play center.</li>
                    <li>i have also volunteered at a pool, assisting instructors.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Beavers:</h4>
                    My Volunteer work at Beavers is an extension to my DofE Bronze Award. 
                    I assist the leaders in setting up the actvities for the 
                    children along with tidying up. Also, I help keep the
                    children entertained and busy.
                 <h4>Soft Play Center:</h4>
                    I worked briefly at a soft play center (called Wild Things) for a few months between 
                    December 2023 - January 2024. I could only work this long as unfortunatley, 
                    they changed the age policy for february, making me unable to work. 
                    whilst I worked there, I took plates and dishes to and from the kitchen 
                    and the seating area for both the children at their party and the parents.
                    I also packed the party bags and prepared the childrens meal.
                <h4>swimming pool:</h4>
                    when I helped at the pool, I assisted the instructor in keeping the children 
                    safe when they were swimming and setting up the toys for their activities.
                    Another one of my responsibilities was to tidy away all of the toys and equipment used.
                    I worked every saturday until I had to stop as they moved away and I was 
                    unable to get there.
