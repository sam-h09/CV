             My Volunteer work at Beavers is an extension to my DofE Bronze Award. 
             I assist the leaders in setting up the activities for the 
             children along with tidying up. Also, I help keep the 
             children entertained and busy.

             <h2>Soft Play Centre:</h2>
                I worked briefly at a soft play centre (called Wild Things) for two months between 
                 December 2023 - January 2024. I could only work this long as unfortunately, 
                 they changed the age policy for February, making me unable to work. 
                whilst I worked there, I took plates and dishes to and from the kitchen 
                and the seating area for both the children at their party and the parents.
                I also packed the party bags and prepared the childrenâ€™s  meal.

                 When I helped at the pool, I assisted the instructor in keeping the children

                 Another one of my responsibilities was to tidy away all the toys and equipment used.
                 I worked every Saturday until I had to stop as they moved away, and I was 
                 unable to get there.

                space & Time</a>, a media company based in the UK. I was there for a week where
                I learned HTML and CSS coding. I used that knowledge to write this CV!
