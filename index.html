             My Volunteer work at Beavers is an extension to my DofE Bronze Award. 
             I assist the leaders in setting up the activities for the 
             children along with tidying up. Also, I help keep the 
             children entertained and busy.

             <h2>soft play centre:</h2>
                I worked briefly at a soft play centre (called Wild Things) for two months between 
                 December 2023 - January 2024. I could only work this long as unfortunately, 
                 they changed the age policy for February, making me unable to work. 
                whilst I worked there, I took plates and dishes to and from the kitchen 
                and the seating area for both the children at their party and the parents.
                I also packed the party bags and prepared the childrenâ€™s  meal.

                 when I helped at the pool, I assisted the instructor in keeping the children 
                 safe when they were swimming and setting up the toys for their activities.
                 Another one of my responsibilities was to tidy away all the toys and equipment used.
                 I worked every Saturday until I had to stop as they moved away, and I was 
                 unable to get there.
